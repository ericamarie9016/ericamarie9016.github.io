# Mapping Illegal Deforestation in Paraguay's National Forests

The Chaco is a 1.1 million km2 ecoregion in South America that, since 1985, has lost 28 percent of its woodlands as a result of widespread conversion to extensive cattle ranching and cropping. With global attention towards the deforestation of this region, policymakers are attempting to implement reforms for forest conservation. Paraguay\'s National Forest Institute (INFONA) have requirements for forest conservation on private properties in the Paraguayan Chaco. Some ranches are not implementing these requirements, continuing in illegal deforestation activities. We want to detect these regions of illegal deforestation and determine the percent of ranch area that is legal versus illegal.

## Workflow

Utilizing the R programming language to complete spatial and statistical analysis of illegal logging in Paraguay\'s Chaco forest. We will overlay layers of current forest cover and approved land-use plans with vector interactions to highlight regions of illegal deforestation.

### Data

1.  Land use: Maps of forest cover (2020), as generated by INFONA.
2.  Permitted land use: INFONA\'s spatial database of land use permits issued in the Chaco between 1994-2022.
