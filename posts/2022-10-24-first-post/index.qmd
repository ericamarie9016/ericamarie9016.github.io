This is my first blog post!

Attached is a photo of an epic adventure I went on in 2020, rafting and canyoneering in the Grand Canyon. I spent several months free after this adventure camping throughout Arizona and California, with no cares in the world \[\^1\] besides finding the best hammock spots! I have switched up my lifestyle going back to graduate school, dressing more like a professional, and am on an adventure of the MIND! It is hard to believe that just several months ago, I was attempting to self-teach programming in my free time and barely had an understanding of the resources available.

[\^1\] It's obvious from my bright clothing choice that I really had no cares in the world...

Why did I decide on this degree? This is a newer field, so others might feel unsure of taking a similar leap. I sure was!

I already have the ecology background (even though there is always more to learn), what I really wanted to gain was the skillset. I originally was speaking to the Director of a Botany master's, and was considering applying for a PhD. I'm still very curious to learn more on botany, but I spent time speaking with several professors (which I highly recommend you do during your search!) and had some life-changing insights.

What do I think of this program?
