<p><strong>The Inaccessibility of Data for Indigenous Groups</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Data Access Could Mean to Indigenous Groups and the Conservation Movement</strong></p>
<p>My goal was to put together an argument about lack of data accessibility and rights to tribes for their own informed decision making, and how industry has taken advantage of the gap and put native’s at risk (health and environmental) with resource extraction. I continue to argue how the field of conservation in Western hands has been at a loss for not including Native traditional management and perspectives on ecological data available.</p>
<section id="introduce-the-issue" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduce-the-issue">Introduce the issue:</h3>
<p>Small communities and indigenous groups around the world have limited access to data and to tools for gathering and utilizing data. This data includes information about their citizens, communities, lands, resources, and culture which has been collected through “satellite research” by entities such as government and academia but not shared with the tribes. This leaves groups vulnerable due to lack of their own tools and infrastructure to incorporate data for decision making, and limited visibility on a global scale. These regions have been taken advantage of by industry and the government, using this global blind spot on indigenous lands and environmental impacts. This invisible gap includes approximately 370 million Indigenous peoples living in 90 countries around the world (United 2009).</p>
</section>
<section id="internet-and-tool-access" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="internet-and-tool-access">Internet and tool access:</h3>
<p>Some tribes have 0 internet accessibility, and few have affordable access, which is why just over half of Native American’s living on reservations with a computer have access to high-speed internet service. This is the lowest percent internet coverage in the nation (Wang 2018). Without internet tribes do not have educational access for the tools to analyze data, or access to the larger global community, which also means their voices are unheard in global conversations, including landscape conservation and resource management.</p>
</section>
<section id="ecological-impact-without-natives" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ecological-impact-without-natives">Ecological impact without Natives:</h3>
<p>There is a larger ecological and conservation impact of these groups being isolated. Without visibility on a global scale, there is not attention towards the industrial pressure on Native landscape. In addition, the knowledge and different perspectives within these tribes that could be brought into conservation efforts for landscape are overlooked. Keeping conservation sciences as “western” science isolates other perspectives and cultural significance of landscapes and ecosystems. Western science has dictated how we view data and how to use it, analyze it, and make decisions from it. Data can be used as a tool for natives to tell stories and turn the information into art to understand the world in a different way, and weigh the data differently for informed decision making.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="examples-of-industry-taking-advantage-of-this-gap-in-data-accessibility-and-land-rights">Examples of industry taking advantage of this gap in data accessibility and land rights:</h3>
<p>Indigenous land rights are only recognized in a few countries around the world, and even in these few there are complications with land titling and the governments have often leased out the lands for resource extraction without consultation (6). In many cases, this has led to indigenous groups have forced to leave their lands due to the destruction of their self-sustaining ecosystems (6). Resource extraction for mineral, oil, gas deposits has caused environmental degradation on native lands without the knowledge of the wider global arena interested in conservation efforts. The native communities have the negative fallout of environmental hazards, and the extracted resources do not go towards them.</p>
<p>“In 2009 An Australian mining company, Azumah Resources Limited, was granted a concession by the government of Ghana giving them more than 2,000 square kilometers of the upper west region, which includes the Tanchara community, for gold prospecting and mining.” (Guri 2022) The mining company was causing rapid decline in the savred groves and other surrounding sites in the community, including significant plant species becoming locally extinct and the loss of wildlife. The natives are often unaware of the decisions, their rights, and the impact. In this case, the threat to their sacred groves and natural sites was reviewed by an outside group (Center for Indigenous Knowledge and Organizational Development in Ghana). This center was able to speak up to the government on behalf of the Natives, who did not have the tools for the impact surveys and the medium to speak up (Guri 2022). This was a win for the community, but often there is no one looking when the rights of tribes are taken advantage of for industrial progress.</p>
<p>Brazil’s indigenous lands are under threat under different political agendas, with Bolsanaro campaigning to opening up indigenous lands to exploitation. He issued an executive order transferring regulation of indigenous reserves from the government’s indigenous agency (FUNAI) to the Ministry of Agriculture, which is invested in agribusiness interests. He further announced plans to open indigenous reserves to development without requiring indigenous consent. Even with government checks returning some of the land rights to indigenous tribes, these actions encouraged a 40% increase of illegal miners entering Indigenous Territory, polluting rivers with mercury (Squires 2020).</p>

<p>How indigenous tribes take care of their land when given rights, data access:</p>
<p>A study reviewing 169 publications of different forms of conservation management found that conservation efforts without Indigenous groups resulted generally in ineffective conservation (Dawson 2019). Indigenous lands generally had higher levels of biodiversity and natural productivity than other managed lands. Equitable conservation provides local groups the tools and empowerment to be stewards of their land (Dawson 2019).</p>
<p>Tribes have a different viewpoint of conservation, connecting the landscape with art and culture. There are different motivations for conserving the ecosystems, and understandings of the ecological interactions. Bringing power to the tribes to protect and conserve their lands will benefit conservation movements as a whole. Ultimately Native voices should be uplifted to have a larger say in conservation efforts outside of their reservations within their historic territories. An example of the different approaches to wildlife management can be found in the first tribal wilderness area, Mission Mountain Wilderness Area, which annually closes off 10,000 acres for grizzly bears to feed high in the mountains undisturbed (Robbins 2021). This extra consideration for the habits of the wildlife are unheard of in western management styles.</p>
<p>Rewrite this: The difference in conservation can be seen in the use of the land. In most cases, traditional use entails sustainable harvesting practices that are vital to the well-being of the resource; in turn, the transmission of such practices to younger generations ensures the sustained relationship that a people has with a particular plant or animal (Maffi 2001b) Difference in resource management style from current conservation: Research on tribal resource access can inform tribal policy and management and thus contribute to both resource- and relationship-based approaches to tribal environmental governance. For example, Cherokee elders stress that, when seeking plant medicine, one should not uproot the first identified plant; rather, one must pass over at least four plant individuals before commencing to gather.</p>
<p>A study reviewing Indigenous-managed lands through Australia, Brazil, and Canada found these areas were richer in vertebrate species than existing government protected landscapes (Robbins 2021).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tie-below-in-with-data-access">Tie below in with data access:</h3>
<p>Indigenous management styles have evolved over centuries with these cultures immersed in nature (Robbins 2021). The style of management differs due to the varied concepts of nature, Indigenous knowledge tending to be more holistic and presenting characteristics to wildlife that westerners only attribute to humans (Robbins 2021). Traditional ecological knowledge had been lost in conservation, such as the traditional use of prescribed fires to manage resources (Robbins 2021). They knew how to use fire to manage wildlife habitat and forests, increasing ecological resilience, and encourage growth of useful species (Robbins 2021). Their management is more active, as they see the land to live with, versus western view of highly developing a region and keeping protected areas isolated. The tribes ensure a healthy landscape and wildlife populations that they can live with and utilize.</p>
<p>Indigenous regions with proper protection are successful with their own interests of conservation, for example some of the world’s healthiest tropical forests are within protected Indigenous areas (Abulu 2022). Without these protections, resource extractive companies will enter often with government support, and the Native’s are unable to resist (Abulu 2022). The integrity of these forests, and overall biodiversity scores, are highest in Indigenous communities compared to any other land management with human development. Most of the high-integrity forests left are occupied by Natives, and conservation efforts must consider protecting both the ecosystem and the people (Abulu 2022). This highlights two issues, one is conservation of the ecosystems, and the other is conservation of the culture and people. The tribes culture and lifestyle is entwined with their surroundings and their management of the landscape, utilizing traditional knowledge to support wildlife and protect ancestral grounds. Creation of protected park areas do not need to remove tribes to protect these ecosystems, it would be more beneficial to provide native’s around the world with land tenure rights and their own ability to manage the landscape.</p>

<p>BisonImage: The National Bison Range in Montana, now managed by the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes.&nbsp;DAVE FITZPATRICK / U.S.FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE</p>
<p>In North America, a previously seized 18000 acres of land set aside for bison conservation has been returned to the tribes. Bison were plentiful before colonization and development, so it is cruelly ironic to have taken the land and bison away from the people who were properly managing the populations before. The U.S. government attempt at managing these populations was isolated from the ancestral knowledge the tribes had of the animals and land, displaying the lack of data transfer between both parties. These animals are considered almost familial to the tribes who once relied on their abundance for food, clothing, and shelter. The change in management back to the tribes has changed the focus of conservation, acknowledging the animal’s characteristics that were otherwise overlooked in western management practices. The native’s management of these herds recognize the importance of family groups and practice to keep these groups together.(Robbins 2021) Prescribed fires were also used to manage the buffalo and landscape traditionally, a practice they are returning</p>
<p>Conservation movement would be stronger with the allies of natives, providing them with the resources and voice to speak up.</p>
<p>COnervation focus open up to not what to conserve, but how to conserve it and who manages it.</p>
<p>Provide access on data collected on the Native’s land from outside groups such as government, academic, and industry. Provide affordable internet and training opportunities for tribal members to learn how to use the tools available. Give the baseline for each tribe to decide how to collect and use their data. Provide them the ability to make their own sovereign decisions, and creative perspective towards data collection and uses, empowering their voices on a global scale. Implement community-based mapping, monitoring, and information systems and provide education to utilize the tools.</p>
<p>Providing land tenure and management to the tribes will benefit conservation as a whole. Across the United States, there has been a slow movement in recent years to return land to native tribes including 1,000 acres of redwood forest in California and a 150 acre island in Maine(Robbins 2021). The Nature Conservancy has also transferred land rights back to native’s on a global scale (Robbins 2021). An increase of co-management with Natives is also benefitting conservation of wildlife and plants. Increasing visibility of the tribes to bring attention to the</p>
<p>The Australian government has bought up a series of farm properties with the goal to restore the beneficial wetlands that were degraded from agriculture and water diversion (Robbins 2021). The government accepted proposals for the management of these wetlands and ultimately gave the right to the Indigenous group Nari Nari who had inhabited the region for 50,000 years (Robbins 2021). This ancestral knowledge held within this tribe is unavailable to outside sources, and invaluable to restore and protect the landscape they lived so closely with (Robbins 2021).</p>
<p>One larger attempt to bring data collection and the power of data to indigenous groups is through the Indigenous Navigator, focuses on Indigenous rights including land and conservation rights, which even includes a Biodiversity program (Calatan 2022). The Indigenous Navigator was created with the spirit of indigenous values and cultures, respecting the diversity of groups around the world. The purpose is to assist with data collection to support each group’s innovation to “contemporary problem-solving through community assessments, mapping, environmental tracking, and support for their livelihoods and social enterprises” (Calatan 2022). Community-based monitoring and information systems allow data to be collected from within the indigenous groups, and are then connected with the Indigenous Navigator to relevant actors on a global scale. This organization collectively attacks the problem of data rights by providing the groups ability to collect their own data, and bringing visibility and connectivity regarding problems faced by the groups.</p>
